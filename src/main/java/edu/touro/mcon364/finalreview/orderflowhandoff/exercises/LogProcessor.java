/**
 * LogProcessor.
 *
 * A server receives log messages from different parts of an application:
 * authentication, payments, reporting, background jobs, and so on. Messages may
 * arrive while earlier messages are still being processed. We want one part of
 * the program to submit log messages, and a small group of worker threads to
 * process those messages in the background.
 *
 * This class represents that log-processing service.
 *
 * The main problem you are solving:
 * - incoming messages need to wait somewhere until a worker is ready for them;
 * - more than one worker may be running at the same time;
 * - every submitted message should be processed once;
 * - while messages are processed, the class must keep accurate summary counts.
 *
 * Requirements:
 * - submit(message) accepts one log message for later processing.
 * - start(workerCount) starts exactly workerCount background workers.
 * - workerCount must be positive.
 * - workers should keep processing while the processor is still accepting work
 *   or while there is still unprocessed work waiting.
 * - stop() tells the processor to stop accepting/expecting more work and waits
 *   until the already-submitted work has been handled.
 * - getTotalProcessed() returns how many log messages have been processed.
 * - getCountsByLevel() returns how many processed messages there were for each
 *   LogLevel.
 * - getCountsByLevel() must not allow callers to mutate this class's internal
 *   state.
 * - The class must behave correctly when multiple threads interact with it.
 *
 * Questions to think about before coding:
 * - Where should submitted messages wait before a worker processes them?
 * - What behavior do we need from that structure: newest first, oldest first,
 *   priority order, or something else?
 * - Which state is shared by multiple threads?
 * - Which operations must be protected so the statistics stay correct?
 * - How will worker threads know when to continue waiting for work and when to
 *   finish?
 * - What should happen if stop() is called while messages are still waiting?
 * - What should the public getter methods return so outside code cannot damage
 *   the processor's internal state?
