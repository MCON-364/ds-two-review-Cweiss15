/**
 * Homework 3 — Building a report from a completed collection.
 *
 * A gradebook already contains a list of assignment submissions. Each submission
 * represents one student's work for one assignment. At this point, the data is
 * not changing while the report is being built. Nothing is being produced by one
 * thread and consumed by another thread. We are simply analyzing a collection
 * that already exists.
 *
 * The job of this class is to answer several reporting questions about that
 * collection and then combine those answers into one SubmissionReport.
 *
 * Before coding, think through the shape of the problem:
 * - What information is already available in each StudentSubmission?
 * - Which questions require counting?
 * - Which questions require calculating a numeric summary?
 * - Which questions require grouping submissions by one field?
 * - Which questions require selecting only some submissions?
 * - Since the input list is already complete, do we need threads here?
 *
 * Requirements:
 * - The constructor receives the submissions that will be analyzed.
 * - The builder must not expose or mutate its internal list of submissions.
 * - getLateCount() returns how many submissions were marked late.
 * - getAverageScore() returns the average score across all submissions.
 * - getSubmissionsByAssignment() returns how many submissions exist for each assignment name.
 * - getFailingSubmissions() returns submissions whose score is below 60.
 * - buildReport() returns a SubmissionReport containing all four pieces of information.
 *
 * Edge cases to consider:
 * - An empty submission list should not cause a crash.
 * - A caller should not be able to change this builder's internal state by
 *   modifying the original list after construction.
 * - Returned collections should not allow callers to mutate the builder's
 *   internal state.
